I am a PhD student at University College London working in the Department of Statistical Science under the supervision of Dr Samuel Livingstone and Prof. Gianluca Baio since September 2021. My research focuses on a new class of Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers based on Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes and their application to Bayesian survival models. 

I have a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Warwick, and an MSc in Statistics from University College London. For my MSc dissertation, I developed a Bayesian hierarchical model for predicting levels of exercise intensity in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. I was supervised by Dr Samuel Livingstone and collaborated with Dr Claire Black from UCLH and Dr Federico Ricciardi from the UCL Statistical Science.
