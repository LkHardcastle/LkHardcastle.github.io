I am a PhD student at University College London working in the Department of Statistical Science under the supervision of Dr Sam Livingstone and Prof. Gianluca Baio. My research focuses on a new class of Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers based on Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes and their application to survival models.
